Written technical guides in a way that is understandable to beginners. Made things a little more accessible. Dived into the nitty gritty of what makes the internet.</p><p>I've asked many questions and keep coming back to some of them: Who are the people I am designing for? How do I find out? And how can I make their lives a little easier?</p><p> Now. What can I do for you?</p></1>",
